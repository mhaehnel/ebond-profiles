card-profiles/

These are the network card power profiles for the eBond-sim power simulator.
You can find find the power simulator at github.com/mhaehnel/eBond

The profiles are named for the model numbers of the network cards.
The files with the ending .prof go into the eBond simulator, the csv files are
the raw profile files as generated by our measurement setup


traffic-profiles/

These are the traffic profiles as used in the eBond paper with seperate up- and
downstream bandwidths. These profiles can be read by eBond as well. The files
are without headers because eBond does not deal with headers. The columns are:

timestamp,"In (Mbit/s)","Out (Mbit/s)","Total (Mbit/s)"
